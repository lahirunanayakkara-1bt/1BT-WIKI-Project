### Use Named Booleans for Compound Conditions in JSX
Never write inline compound boolean expressions directly inside JSX conditionals.
Instead, extract them into a clearly named `const` before the `return` statement.

**❌ Don't do this:**
```tsx
{article.status === 'Draft' || article.status === 'Rejected' ? (
  <EditLink />
) : (
  <DisabledButton />
)}
```

**✅ Do this instead:**
```tsx
const canEdit = article.status === 'Draft' || article.status === 'Rejected';

// ...

{canEdit ? (
  <EditLink />
) : (
  <DisabledButton />
)}
```

This applies to any multi-part condition (two or more `&&` / `||` operands) used as a JSX conditional, including ternaries and short-circuit renders (`condition && <Component />`).
